NAME
	redshift-adjust - Script for manually adjusting the
	                  colour temperature with hotkeys

SYNOPSIS
	redshift-adjust (-p | ADJUSTMENT)

DESCRIPTION
	redshift-adjust uses redshift to adjust the colour
	temperature to either an absolute or a relative
	colour temperature. If a colour temperature has
	not been set using redshift-adjust, redshift-adjust
	will assume that the current colour temperature
	is 6500 Kelvin.

OPTIONS
	-p      Print the current colour temperature.

ADJUSTMENTS
	=TEMP   Set the colour temperature to TEMP Kelvin.
	+TEMP   Increase the colour temperature by TEMP Kelvin.
	-TEMP   Decrease the colour temperature by TEMP Kelvin.
